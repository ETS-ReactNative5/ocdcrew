        <p>From the time I called Mandy to the actual service being done she exceeded expectations! Being responsive, useful suggestions and answered all of my questions. She is super detail oriented, hard working and did a great job, the name OCD cleaning is fitting and what else would you want with a cleaner?! Mandy has enhanced the reputation of my Corporate Housing company with her standards and I am forever grateful for her job well done, every time!</p>
